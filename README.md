# TidyTuesday

#### Tidy Tuesday is a weekly data project aimed at the R ecosystem. This project was borne out of the `R4DS Online Learning Community` and the `R for Data Science` textbook, an emphasis was placed on understanding how to summarize and arrange data to make meaningful charts with `ggplot2`, `tidyr`, `dplyr`, and other tools in the `tidyverse` ecosystem.

#### ⚔️ Avatar: The Latest Airbender and The Office by IMDb is the base inspiration for this piece of work. Code is also from the above two GitHub repos

#### I was looking for a neat visualisation for sleep stages (measured in percentages)

#### Final visualisation
